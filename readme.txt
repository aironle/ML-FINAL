BUGS:	Neural Network Method Does not work but is researched


Project Description:	Prediction of corporate finance incidents


Who Did What:	We always sat down together to work on the project. 
				Both coded, research, and debugged
				Jared was more proficient with Matlab working with both linear regression & Neural Network
				Aaron was able to program on the linear regression and the research for Neural Network.
					Figured out what was missing and what was needed.
				Both worked on the report and presentation
